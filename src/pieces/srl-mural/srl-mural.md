Commissioned mural for London-based soda company [Square Root London](http://squarerootsoda.co.uk/). I worked with the owners to create a design that incorporated key elements of their production process: Their railway arch, delivery and draught bikes, and the fresh ingredients that go into every bottle.

Acrylic on board, 2016.
