AIOD (All In One Day) is a work-in-progress graphic novel documenting my first visit to Latvia, where my parents were born and raised, to meet my grandmother and bring her to the United States. Itâ€™s the story of mental health, ageing, immigration, and a dark sense of humour spanning several generations.

Digital and physical illustration, photography and video, to be released online in parts.
